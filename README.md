It's the folder containing the code and the modules for the raspberry computational node.
That Multithreading SW will host the web user interface, manage sensor data and some sensors and actuators as luminosity sensor, smart plugs, hue lights.


##### UserPC_App
Contains the code of the SW running on the user's PC and monitoring their web activities and the microphone.
